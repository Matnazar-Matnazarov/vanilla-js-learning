# Issue Templates

Please choose the appropriate template for your issue:

- 🐛 **Bug Report** - Report a bug or error in the code
- ✨ **Feature Request** - Suggest a new feature or enhancement
- ❓ **Question** - Ask a question about the course or code
- 📖 **Lesson Improvement** - Suggest improvements for a specific lesson

If none of these templates fit your needs, you can still create a blank issue, but please provide as much detail as possible.
